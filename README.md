The code implements the numerical tests using the ALS and ORALS algorithms. The tests examine the dependence of their accuracy on three key parameters: sample size, level of observation noise, and the strength of the stochastic force. They also examine the robustness with respect to possible misspecification of the model (i.e., the hypothesis space does not contain the true interaction kernel).
